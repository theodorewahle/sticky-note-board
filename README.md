## Functionality 

You can add notes, delete notes, drag notes, and edit notes. The notes and their positions should persist in our database.

## Design

I chose a blue background with a simple single-line text entry bar for the titles. When you compose a note, it gets added at a random location. Then, you can drag it around. 

## Implementation

I used React + Firebase.
